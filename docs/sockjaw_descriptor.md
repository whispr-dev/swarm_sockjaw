- Dynamic Neural Architecture (Neural Architecture Search) and Meta-Learning Capabilities
- A swarm intelligence system employing a Swarm Environment, Agent Communication and Swarm Optimization.
- Swarm level set of GANs using both vision and NLP capabilities and one arm bandit algorythm.
- Encryption, Sophisticated Polymorphism, Packing/Unpacking, Dead Code and Control Flow Obfuscation capabilities. 
- Traffic Shaping and Mimicry, Encrypted and Fragmented Communication and Adaptive Evasion capabilities.
- Advanced headless browsing capabilities and password bruteforcing tools.
- Self-monitoring and analysi, periodic analyzis of actions and outcomes to refine its decision-making algorithms.
- Subtly influence network traffic via network engineering and even social engineering to achieve redirection inc via modifying network parameters.
- Scope for a variety of methods to observe human activity and learn to mimic it and learn from it.
- Bayesian network capability allows for probabalistic reasoning capabilities so the AI can cope better in situations of unceertainty.

* Swarm works together or compete, sharing information to improve overall performance. 
* Swarm level set of GANs use one arm bandit algorythm.for env analysisinc combined text and image analysis using both vision and NLP capabilities.
