- [Example Python Code to Fetch Proxies]
You can use requests in Python to fetch proxy lists from these APIs:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.proxyscrape.com/?request=getproxies&proxytype=http&timeout=1000&country=all"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    proxy_list = response.text.splitlines()
    print("Proxy List:", proxy_list)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve proxies.")
```

- These services typically offer a range of filters (e.g., anonymity, country, protocol) that you can apply to customize the proxy list according to your needs. However, free proxies can be unreliable and may have slow speeds or limited availability. Always ensure you're complying with the terms of service of the proxies you use, especially if you're accessing them through an API.
