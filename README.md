 a jellyfish very well designed for avoiding lobsterpots

2208242153

this project was to create a jellyfish as capable as possible of avoiding lobsterpot sand other such pitfalls

ofc this means in all reality it's a very very advanced 'virus' except it's as benign as i could possibly make it so it really is more of a 'benign traveller' - it merely drifts from url to url, navigating around the web, not even sniffing packets or anything cheeky like that.

it has the same AI brain basis as the lobsterpot, an RNN/CNN/LSTM three way GAN assisted by a central ganglion with cellular automaton central control layer featuring crosstalk.#

ontop of that the jellyfish features, variously:
-  Multiple epochs trained actor-critic model, prioritizing experiences from 
 replay buffer,
 - Proxy pool, polymorphic code generation and an Advanced Training Loop:
 - CAPTCHA solving, randomized time delays, user-agent randomization,
 - Dynamic Neural Architecture (Neural Architecture Search) and Meta-Learning capabilities
-  A swarm intelligence system employing a Swarm Environment, Agent 
communication and Swarm Optimization.
 - Swarm level set of GANs using both vision and NLP capabilities and one arm bandit algorythm.
 - Encryption, Sophisticated Polymorphism, Packing/Unpacking, Dead Code and 
control Flow Obfuscation capabilities. 
-  Traffic Shaping and Mimicry, Encrypted and Fragmented Communication and 
adaptive Evasion capabilities.
-  Advanced headless browsing capabilities and password bruteforcing tools.
-  Self-monitoring and analysi, periodic analyzis of actions and outcomes to 
refine its decision-making algorithms.
- Subtly influence network traffic via network engineering and even social 
engineering to achieve redirection inc via modifying network parameters.
- Scope for a variety of methods to observe human activity and learn to 
mimic it and learn from it.
- Bayesian network capability allows for probabalistic reasoning 
capabilities so the AI can cope better in situations of unceertainty.

code
it's initially writtien entirely in Python but there are good reasons to convert into C++ afterwards as an extension to the project.

it seems to have evened out at about 2500lines of code at point of equilibrium so i guess that gives an idea of the scope of the project.

dependencies
- the code requires CromeDriver.exe and a requirements.txt to run curretly but i would prefer it all consolidated into one package so am considering options rn.
- also it uses an absolute shed-load of libraries so there's further argument for consolidation into one package or compiling as another language.
